# BeatDrop Music Visualizer

BeatDrop Music Visualizer is an improved standalone version of the original forked inactive repository based of the [Original MilkDrop2 Plug-in](https://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/) for [Winamp](https://winamp.com) that aims to add better features and bug fixes/optimizations for versatility and interesting. This also aims as MilkDrop improvement.

- Perfectly adjusted beat detection for better audio reaction (also configurable)
- New waveforms and transitions
- 16 custom shapes and waves limit
- [Spout](https://spout.zeal.co) Integration
- Hard Cut Modes, Transparency Mode, Playback Controls, Startup Preset etc.
- And so much more!

# BEFORE YOU RUN BEATDROP

# HOW TO USE BEATDROP

1. First, use any audio output if you want before running

![Audio Output Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd611b87-a62a-4769-9c24-72ce333f38f2)

2. Easily run BeatDrop!
3. If you did the first step, change it back to the default audio output, instead remain what it was.
4. Open [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com), [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru) or any media players/audio sources and let them play! (Yes! It reacts to all the audio sources)
5. Watch them react and enjoy! ðŸ‘ŒðŸª©

# USAGE

You can use BeatDrop for parties, karaoke, music videos, DJ mixes and so on, but you must credit this repo if you used this! I am not even angry anymore if you didn't credit this, but use #beatdrop, #beatdropmusicvisualizer or BeatDrop as tags, then I'll look at them.
