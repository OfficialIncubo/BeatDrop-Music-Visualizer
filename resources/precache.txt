# BeatDrop now supports precaching shaders for quicker load presets.
# Recommended to lock the preset or not loading another preset while precaching.
# Precache the following shaders on visualizer startup if:
#
# - bShaderCaching=1 is set in settings.ini
# - bShaderPrecachingAtStartup=1 is set in settings.ini
# - The file ResourceDir\shadercache\cached.txt does not exist
#
# You can remove or empty the cache folder safely anytime. Use relative or 
# absolute paths for the presets. The base directory for relative paths is 
# the resource directory. You can put an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to include 
# all contents of a directory.
#
# A list of compiled files, along with compilation time per file in 
# milliseconds, are written to shadercache\cached.txt.
#
# Specify the preset path below to precache shaders.
