# Future plans

- [ ] Aero-like Effect (For example, Nomi's Video: <https://x.com/nomimugen/status/1789240101085557050>)
- [ ] Spout Input as Sprites (like NestDrop's Spout Sprites): <https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer/issues/26>
- [ ] GIF Support for both Sprites and Textures
- [ ] Reviving 3D functionality from MilkDrop v1.04
- [ ] Screensaver Support
- [ ] Desktop Mode

# For the next (or further) version of BeatDrop
- [ ] Window-Independent Spout Output (<https://github.com/IkeC/Milkwave/commit/946698de0341e1cde4c61e4380116629282f39e0>)
- [ ] Ability to change the audio device from output to input (microphone) and vice-versa by pressing B hotkey
- [ ] Freeze/unfreeze beat detection
- [ ] Enable/Disable Mashup Functionality
- New Hardcut Modes (0/2):
- [ ] BPM (1/4/8/16/32 beats)
- [ ] Improved Kinetronix (Visikord) Hardcut Mode (with BPM Algorithm)

# Features to be worked for updating the v1.4.1 release
- [x] Adding DirectX Portable Files in case who don't have access to install DirectX Web Runtime via User Account Control.
- [ ] Correctly adapt the renderer resolution to Spout resolution at startup (In Windows 10 or in any DPI, it didn't perfectly adapt).

There are more that it's unfeatured here. Let me know if you tell some features to be added here.
