Added init/per-frame/per-vertex variables: mousex, mousey, mousedown, mouseclick

Mouse controls:
mouse_x - retrieves the X position of mouse
mouse_y - retrieves the Y position of mouse
mouse_pos - retrieves the XY position of mouse

You can also use:
mouse.x - retrieves the X position of mouse
mouse.y - retrieves the Y position of mouse
mouse.z - retrieves if the left or right button of the mouse is down or not, getting X mouse coordinate (positive if held, otherwise negative)
mouse.w - retrieves if the left or right button of the mouse is clicked (button up) or not, getting Y mouse coordinate (positive if clicked, otherwise negative)

Note that both mouse coordinates return -1 when the pointer is outside the window. Make sure you add statements while editing presets.
If you want to really use with mouse down/click events, just pass these per-frame variables mentioned above to q variables and then assign mouse.z or mouse.w with any q variable you assigned (e.g. mouse.z = (any q var);).
